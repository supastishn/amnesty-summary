**Main Conclusion:** The report concludes that there is sufficient evidence to determine that Israel committed and is committing genocide against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip following the Hamas-led attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023 (pp. 35, 283).

**Framework:** The analysis is based on the 1948 UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Genocide Convention) (pp. 13, 17, 85). Amnesty International assesses Israel's policies, actions, and omissions between 7 October 2023 and early July 2024 (with some data updated later) against the definition of genocide provided in the convention (pp. 13, 39, 41).

**Prohibited Acts Identified:** The report finds sufficient basis to conclude that Israel committed three of the five prohibited acts under the Genocide Convention (pp. 13, 35, 283):
*   Killing members of the group (Palestinians in Gaza) (pp. 18-20, 35, 106).
*   Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group (pp. 18-20, 35, 106).
*   Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part (pp. 21-30, 35, 123).

**Genocidal Intent (Dolus Specialis):** Amnesty International argues that these acts were committed with the specific intent required for genocide â€“ the intent to destroy Palestinians in Gaza, as such (pp. 31, 35, 202, 281). This intent is inferred from:
*   The overall **pattern of conduct**: Including repeated unlawful attacks causing mass civilian casualties, the scale and speed of destruction of homes and essential infrastructure, the repeated mass forced displacement under inhumane conditions, and the sustained denial and obstruction of life-saving aid despite warnings and ICJ orders (pp. 31, 205-206, 279).
*   **Dehumanizing rhetoric**: Analyzing statements by Israeli officials, military figures, and soldiers that dehumanized Palestinians (pp. 33, 203, 235).
*   **Statements calling for destruction**: Documenting numerous public statements by Israeli officials that appeared to call for or justify the destruction of Palestinians in Gaza (pp. 33-34, 203, 241).
*   **Destruction of cultural and religious sites**: Documenting the widespread destruction of mosques, universities, archives, and heritage sites, sometimes through controlled demolitions after Israeli forces had secured control, suggesting an intent beyond military necessity (pp. 32-33, 216-217).
*   **Torture and ill-treatment**: Citing a pattern of incommunicado detention, torture, and other ill-treatment of Palestinians from Gaza as underscoring systematic dehumanization (pp. 12, 31, 233-234).

**Methodology:** The findings are based on:
*   Interviews with 212 people, including victims, witnesses, survivors, humanitarian workers, medical staff, and local officials (pp. 13, 43).
*   Analysis of extensive visual and digital evidence (satellite imagery, photos, videos) (pp. 14, 44).
*   Review of reports and data from UN agencies, NGOs, human rights groups, and media (pp. 14, 44).
*   Analysis of statements by Israeli and Hamas officials (pp. 14, 44-45).
*   Review of legal documents, including submissions to the ICJ (pp. 14, 44).

**Context:** The report situates the events since 7 October 2023 within the broader context of Israel's prolonged military occupation of Palestinian territories, its system of apartheid against Palestinians, and the 17-year unlawful blockade of Gaza, arguing these created pre-existing vulnerability and laid the groundwork for genocidal acts (pp. 13, 32, 47, 202).

**Recommendations:** The report includes extensive recommendations (pp. 283-294) aimed at:
*   **Israeli authorities:** To immediately cease genocidal acts, comply with IHL and human rights law, allow full humanitarian access, end the occupation and apartheid system, cooperate fully with international investigations (including the ICJ), and ensure accountability (pp. 284-288).
*   **Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups:** To release civilian hostages, treat captives humanely, and comply with IHL (p. 288-289).
*   **Third States:** To take steps to end Israeli actions amounting to genocide, ensure Israel complies with ICJ orders, suspend arms transfers to Israel, support accountability mechanisms (ICJ, ICC), and impose targeted sanctions (pp. 289-291).
*   **UN bodies (Security Council, General Assembly, Human Rights Council) and the ICC Prosecutor:** To take specific actions related to ceasefires, arms embargoes, accountability, investigations (including into genocide and apartheid), and ensuring compliance with international law (pp. 292-294).
