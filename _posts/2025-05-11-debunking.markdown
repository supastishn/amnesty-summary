Here, I shall debunk the most common pro-Israeli arguments.

1. This is an appeal to authority.
**No.** My argment is not based off the fact that a human rights organization said so - it is based off the points and methodology said human rights organization used.

2. Why should I trust you?
I'm not the one making the points. I'm merely summarizing Amnesty International's document, whose methodology can be found on this website

3. You're antisemetic!
First of all, I do not hate the Jews. Second of all, even if this *was* true, this point is ad homineJews. Second of all, even if this *was* true, this point is ad hominem.

4. How do we know Amnesty International is true?
See the methodology of the report on my website.
