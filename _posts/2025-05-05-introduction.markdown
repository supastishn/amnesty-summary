(The Amnesty document 'You Feel Like You Are Subhuman" is not owned by me.)

There is a genocide occuring right now - and your money may be paying it.

In Gaza. Israel is relentlessly killing women and children, with over *seventy* percent of deaths being women and children.

Israel is also committing other crimws, such as starving Gazans. Since Israel refused to extend the ceasefire into the next phases, Israel has put Gaza on a complete blockade, with no aid allowed to enter, despite legal obligation to do so.

"But isn't this just a consequence of war?".

While war certainly is terrible, a lot of what Israel is doing cannot be justified by war.

The [Amnesty International Document](https://www.amnesty.org/en/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/MDE1586682024ENGLISH.pdf), and the summaries on my website, shall go into more details on this.
