**Chapter 8: CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS (pp. 283-294)**

This chapter presents Amnesty International's overall conclusion based on the report's findings and provides a comprehensive set of recommendations to various actors.

**8.1 CONCLUSION (p. 283)**

*   **Finding of Genocide:** Through its research and legal analysis, Amnesty International (AI) has found sufficient basis to conclude that Israel committed, during the nine-month period under review (7 October 2023 - early July 2024), prohibited acts under Articles II (a), (b), and (c) of the Genocide Convention. These acts are:
    *   Killing Palestinians in Gaza.
    *   Causing serious bodily or mental harm to Palestinians in Gaza.
    *   Deliberately inflicting on Palestinians in Gaza conditions of life calculated to bring about their physical destruction in whole or in part.
*   **Specific Intent:** AI also found sufficient basis to conclude that these acts were committed with the **specific intent to destroy Palestinians in Gaza, as such**, who form a substantial part of the Palestinian population (a protected group under the Convention).
*   **Overall Conclusion:** Therefore, AI concludes that Israel, through its policies, actions, and omissions against Palestinians in Gaza following 7 October 2023, **committed and is committing genocide.**
*   **Ongoing Violations & Need for Further Investigation:** AI notes it is unaware of evidence suggesting Israel’s policies have significantly changed since the research period. The commission of genocide engages Israel’s responsibility under the Genocide Convention. Further investigations and determinations by judicial and non-judicial bodies (ICJ, UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry) are warranted.

**8.2 RECOMMENDATIONS (pp. 283-294)**

AI makes a range of recommendations to urgently end the commission of prohibited acts, prevent future acts, and ensure justice, accountability, and full reparation.

*   **8.2.1 Israeli Authorities (pp. 284-288):**
    *   **Acts of Genocide:**
        *   Immediately stop committing prohibited genocidal acts.
        *   Prevent further commission of such acts by any state organ.
        *   Suspend, investigate, and prosecute officials suspected of responsibility for genocide or related crimes.
        *   Cooperate fully with ICJ proceedings, including complying with all provisional measures.
        *   Engage fully with international investigations into genocide.
    *   **Humanitarian Situation:**
        *   Agree to and uphold an immediate, sustained ceasefire.
        *   Protect and facilitate humanitarian access and delivery of aid.
        *   Allow unhindered passage of all essential supplies (food, water, medicine, fuel, electricity).

    *   Do not render aid or assistance in maintaining the unlawful occupation and apartheid system.

    *   Pressure Israel to allow entry to international investigative mechanisms.

    *   Urgently act to ensure justice and accountability for their alleged international crimes.
